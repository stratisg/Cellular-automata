# Cellular-automata
## What is a cellular automaton?

## Overview
This project aims to build a Python package for creating and studying cellular automata. This package allows the user to:
- Choose the system's geometry.
- Choose the update rule that determines the system's future state.
- Build a probabilistic cellular automaton.
- Visualize the evolution of the system over time.

## How to run the project
One can run the examples in the src directory to 
_How does one execute the code and what are we expected to see? 
Do we need to install any external libraries or tools?_

## Examples


## Code conventions
We follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
There is currently no automation set up to enforce static analysis checks, but it can be a future improvement.

## Testing
TBD
