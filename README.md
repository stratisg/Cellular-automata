# Cellular-automata
Work on cellular automata

## Overview
This project aims to use Python to construct cellular automata in 1D and 2D.
We want to study the importance of the different rules for the time evolution
of a cellular automaton. This package allows the user to do the following:
- Choose the system's dimensionality.
- Choose the neighborhood for each site that will determines that site's 
future state.
- Choose the function that determines the future state of a site given its
past and present states as well as those of the sites in its neighborhood.
- Build a probabilistic cellular automaton.
- Build a cellular automaton that its governing laws are dynamic.
- Visualize the automata as a function of time in a movie.

## Structure
The project is very small, therefore we keep everything under the root folder for now. 
In the future we might want to introduce a folder structure for documentation, data, and source code.

## How to run the project
TBD. 
_How does one execute the code and what are we expected to see? 
Do we need to install any external libraries or tools?_

## Code conventions
We follow the [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
There is currently no automation set up to enforce static analysis checks, but it can be a future improvement.

## Development Process
We follow [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/). 
## Testing
TBD
